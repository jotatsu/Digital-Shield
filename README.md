# Digital Shield

The objective of digital shield is a help to normalize life after the massive quarantines every country is suffering right now. As the virus will be circulating around for an unpredictable ammount of time until a vaccine is developed. Economies must resume their workings but at the same time life and privacy should be respected.  This application is not a "solve all" solution, it should be used with medical, pulic policy and other techonological tools. 

The way this application works is by generating what is call a "contact" via bluetooth technology. A "contact" indicates 2 persons were physically close for an ammount of time. Those "contacts" are collected in a privacy focus way way in a central server.

Once a case of coronavirus is detected via a test, a "contact trace" is launched looking back in the past for all the people that this person was in contact with and alerting them. depending on the ammount of time passed, the secundary "contacts" can already be transmitting so a launch will also launch for them and so forth.
